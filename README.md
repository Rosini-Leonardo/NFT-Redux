## Pick Me - Redux

Link to the Final project:
https://redux-pick-me.netlify.app/

Let's build a liberary of photos thanks to the UNSPLASH API and add a nice cart and a checkout and manage all our states with redux / toolkit

In this project we will use several libraries:

__Redux Toolkit__: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
Used to manage our states by separating UI management from state management hardware

__styled-system__: https://styled-system.com/
Allows you to create dynamic components with variants and which accept properties to manage layout, style and mediaquery properties directly from the component

__styled-components__: https://styled-components.com/
Used to define components with integrated style

__Formik__: https://formik.org/docs/overview
Very useful library that allows us to manage, validate and submit our forms without the need to define local states

__Yup__: https://github.com/jquense/yup
It allows you to create advanced validation schemes

__Reach Router__:
Router used in the project
