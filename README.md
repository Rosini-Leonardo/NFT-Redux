## Pick Me - Redux

Let's build a liberary of photos thanks to the UNSPLASH API and add a nice cart and a  
checkout and manage all our states with redux / toolkit

In this project it's used several libraries:

__Redux Toolkit__: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/  
Used to manage our states by separating UI management from state management hardware

__styled-system__: https://styled-system.com/  
Allows you to create dynamic components with variants and which accept properties to manage layout, style and mediaquery properties directly from the component

__styled-components__: https://styled-components.com/  
Used to define components with integrated style

__Formik__: https://formik.org/docs/overview  
Very useful library that allows us to manage, validate and submit our forms without the need to define local states

__Yup__: https://github.com/jquense/yup  
It allows you to create advanced validation schemes

__Reach Router__:  
Router used in the project  
https://reach.tech/router/

### Make it work

To make the project work on localhost you have to install
the folder and then with the command  
`npm install` install all dependencies.  
Excellent !  
Now you are ready to make the project work, simple isn't it? ðŸ˜‰
